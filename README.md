# Code Refractor

The challenge was to take the existing code and tweek it to be compliant to accessability standards, as well as simplify and group stylings for easier readability.

## Description

With the raw code, a few things were wrong. first, just by going throught the website, not all of the tabs would work. I had to begin by recoding and grouping all the tabs the same so that they would all work. Once that was figured out, the page appeared to be working. However, by looking at the HTML and CSS, there were alot of redundencies within. My next task was to group and modify the CSS so that we had less lines of codem easier comprehension, and less redundencies within. Once that was completed, I went and added semantics. There was no reason for so many <div>, so I changed them to the appropriate tags, such as, section, header, and footer. I then had to make sure everything was up to accessability standards. That meant I had to add the appropriate alt tags to images to describe the overall message they were conveying. Once that was finished, I went and made sure everything still looked the same, that it was easier to read, and that the wensite was completely functional.
